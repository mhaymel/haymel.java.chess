/*
		Description of the universal chess interface (UCI)    April  2006
		=================================================================
		
		* The specification is independent of the operating system. For Windows,
		  the engine is a normal exe file, either a console or "real" windows application.
		
		* all communication is done via standard input and output with text commands,
		
		* The engine should boot and wait for input from the GUI,
		  the engine should wait for the "isready" or "setoption" command to set up its internal parameters
		  as the boot process should be as quick as possible.
		
		* the engine must always be able to process input from stdin, even while thinking.
		
		* all command strings the engine receives will end with '\n',
		  also all commands the GUI receives should end with '\n',
		  Note: '\n' can be 0x0d or 0x0a0d or any combination depending on your OS.
		  If you use Engine and GUI in the same OS this should be no problem if you communicate in text mode,
		  but be aware of this when for example running a Linux engine in a Windows GUI.
		
		* arbitrary white space between tokens is allowed
		  Example: "debug on\n" and  "   debug     on  \n" and "\t  debug \t  \t\ton\t  \n"
		  all set the debug mode of the engine on.
		
		* The engine will always be in forced mode which means it should never start calculating
		  or pondering without receiving a "go" command first.
		
		* Before the engine is asked to search on a position, there will always be a position command
		  to tell the engine about the current position.
		
		* by default all the opening book handling is done by the GUI,
		  but there is an option for the engine to use its own book ("OwnBook" option, see below)
		
		* if the engine or the GUI receives an unknown command or token it should just ignore it and try to
		  parse the rest of the string in this line.
		  Examples: "joho debug on\n" should switch the debug mode on given that joho is not defined,
		            "debug joho on\n" will be undefined however.
		
		* if the engine receives a command which is not supposed to come, for example "stop" when the engine is
		  not calculating, it should also just ignore it.
		  
		
		Move format:
		------------
		
		The move format is in long algebraic notation.
		A nullmove from the Engine to the GUI should be sent as 0000.
		Examples:  e2e4, e7e5, e1g1 (white short castling), e7e8q (for promotion)
		
		
		GUI to engine:
		--------------
		
		These are all the command the engine gets from the interface.

			to help debugging, e.g. the commands that the engine has received etc.
			This mode should be switched off by default and this command can be sent

			to ping the engine to find out if it is still alive.
			E.g. this should be sent after setting the path to the tablebases as this can take some time.
			This command is also required once before the engine is asked to do any search
			to wait for the engine to finish initializing.
			This command must always be answered with "readyok" and can be sent also when the engine is calculating
			in which case the engine should also immediately answer with "readyok" without stopping the search.

			The name and value of the option in <id> should not be case sensitive and can inlude spaces.
			The substrings "value" and "name" should be avoided in <id> and <x> to allow unambiguous parsing,
			for example do not use <name> = "draw value".
			Here are some strings for the example below:
			   "setoption name Nullmove value true\n"
		       "setoption name Selectivity value 3\n"
			   "setoption name Style value Risky\n"

			* name <x>
			   the engine should be registered with the name <x>

		   also the next position from a testsuite with positions only.
		   If the GUI hasn't sent a "ucinewgame" before the first "position" command, the engine shouldn't
		   expect any further ucinewgame commands as the GUI is probably not supporting the ucinewgame command.
		   So the engine should not rely on this command even though all new GUIs should support it.
		   As the engine's reaction to "ucinewgame" can take some time the GUI should always send "isready"

		go
			start calculating on the current position set up with the "position" command.
			There are a number of commands that can follow this command, all will be sent in the same string.
			If one command is not sent its value should be interpreted as it would not influence the search.
			* searchmoves <move1> .... <movei>
				restrict search to this moves only
				Example: After "position startpos" and "go infinite searchmoves e2e4 d2d4"
				the engine should only search the two moves e2e4 and d2d4 in the initial position.
			* ponder
				start searching in pondering mode.
				Do not exit the search in ponder mode, even if it's mate!
				This means that the last move sent in in the position string is the ponder move.
				The engine can do what it wants to do, but after a "ponderhit" command
				it should execute the suggested move to ponder on. This means that the ponder move sent by
				the GUI can be interpreted as a recommendation about which move to ponder. However, if the
				engine decides to ponder on a different move, it should not display any mainlines as they are
				likely to be misinterpreted by the GUI because the GUI expects the engine to ponder
			   on the suggested move.
			* wtime <x>
				white has x msec left on the clock
			* btime <x>
				black has x msec left on the clock
			* winc <x>
				white increment per move in mseconds if x > 0
			* binc <x>
				black increment per move in mseconds if x > 0
			* movestogo <x>
		      there are x moves to the next time control,
				this will only be sent if x > 0,
				if you don't get this and get the wtime and btime it's sudden death
			* depth <x>
				search x plies only.
			* nodes <x>
			   search x nodes only,
			* mate <x>
				search for a mate in x moves
			* movetime <x>
				search exactly x mseconds
			* infinite
				search until the "stop" command. Do not exit the search without being told so in this mode!
