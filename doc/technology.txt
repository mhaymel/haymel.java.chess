
quiescence search
- if the current value of the position is outside of [alpha, beta] do not
  generate any moves if the difference is greater than the value of a queen.
  stop the search

- if the value of the captured piece is less than the difference of the current 
  position value and the alpha, beta value, ignore this capture move.
  
  
make moves, move generation
- if a king moves two fields, it must be a castling assuming
  the move generation is correct.
  

iterative search
 - if a mate was detected in an iteration no further iteration
   is required and the iterative search can be stopped.
  
stop quiescence search if difference is greater than a queen

special make move function for capture moves (quiescence search)
 - no castling
 - no pawan double step (enpassant)
 - no promotion but capture promotion is possible
	
time management
 - reduce search time, if opponent plays move of last pv
