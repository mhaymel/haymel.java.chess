- compacting piece list after position was set via uci interface to minimize iteration
  be careful to keep the moves already made so that repetition check still works
  
- remove Game.containsWhitePiece(), Game.containsBlackPiece(), PieceList.contains()
- MoveFinderTest: add capturePromotionTests
- create class FenFromPosition and use it in unit tests
- create a parameterized test for make move with fen and expected fen
- assert generating of capture moves with normal move generation and vice versa
- improve time management
- improve stopping of search
- implement 3 malige stellungswiederholung
- unit tests
- refactor IterativeSearch
- refactor SearchAlphaBeta
- refactor SearchExecutor
- implement 50 moves rule

		
- slow unit tests für perftest für diverse stellungen

- report correct number of possible moves via uci and the correct number of the currently analyzed move

- assert Field.rank(from) == 1 || Field.rank(from) == 6;
	instead  1 a2_h2 etc

- use StringFromMove instead of static methods in unit tests

- MakeBlackQueenSideCastlingMoveTest.java   	public void enPassantIsSetCorrectly()
